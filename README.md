# Asynchronous File Upload
A bit of trickery to simulate an AJAX file upload.

## HTML
A file tag within a form tag, and an invisible iframe. The form tag's `action` attribute is set to the id of the iframe. There is also a div, id `pnlMessage`, for displaying error/success messages.

## PHP
Upon file upload, this PHP script attempts to save the file to the `uploads` folder and outputs either a success or error message. A bit of JavaScript at the end delivers the message into `pnlMessage`.
